# Set removable devices location. The default is to ignore /dev/sda*, which is
# usually the primary system drive. Devices such as SD card readers show up as
# /dev/mmcblk* and are also matched. This string is matched using grep like so:
# udisks --enumerate-device-files | grep -ow ${removable_devices} | sort

# Set whether to show internal devices. This can be "0" or "1". If you have

### This example will match any device with "Photosmart" in any field.

### This example matches only the model field, to reduce false positives.

### This example matches several different devices. Note that the array can be
